SDHS Elo Ranking
================

This takes all the Hearthstone tournaments from http://showdowngg.challonge.com and takes all the matches and uses [Trueskill](http://trueskill.org/) to calculate an Elo for each player.

With some tweaking it should be able to be used with other tournaments as well.

## Dependencies
- [pychallonge](https://github.com/russ-/pychallonge)
- [TrueSkill](http://trueskill.org)
